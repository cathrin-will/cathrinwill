# Generate Icons

Add your SVG icons to `/assets/icons` and run the script:

`node ./generate-icons.js`

An `index.js` file will be created which exports all Icons for use in the icons component.

Then using an icon anywhere is as simple as:

```
import Icon from '@components/icon'

<Icon icon="search" />
```

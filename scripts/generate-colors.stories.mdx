# Generate Colours

Generate the Storybook CSS colours page from settings.json colour variables, as well as add them to `colors.scss` which gets imported to `settings.scss`.

`node --experimental-json-modules ./scripts/generate-colors.js`

or `yarn gen-colors`

## Notes

If two colours in a group have the same hex values, only one will be output.

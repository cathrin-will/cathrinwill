# Generate Components

Generate components with Jest, Storybook and Notes files instantly.

`yarn new ComponentName`

If the component already exisits a warning will be displayed and you will not proceed.

After generating the component the terminal will display a success message to say the component has been built, and that the import line has been copied to your clipboard (With folder alias):

```
% yarn new Button
yarn run v1.22.18
$ node ./scripts/generate-components.js Button
button Component created
button import copied to clipboard!

import Button from "@components/button"
```

When defining a component name it must start with a capital letter:

`yarn new Component`

Components with multiple words should be capitalised for the script to add a dash between each word:

`yarn new MyNewComponent`

## Generating a page

There is also a shortcut to generate a page.
The command is exactly the same, with the `--page` argument

`yarn new Page --page`

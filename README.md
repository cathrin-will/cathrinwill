<p>This is my personal portfolio site if you wanted to run it locally get started by first running `yarn install` then `yarn dev`, and if that didn't work pay attention to he `.nvmrc` file as this tells you the node version.</p>


<p>But most liklely you're here to peep at my code, after seeing the website. So I've attached a screenshot of what you can't see from the sanity cms:</p>

<p>As this is my portfolio site, it means it's always a WIP, I break my own coding rules sometimes and every few years I find new fun tech and have to rebuild.</p>

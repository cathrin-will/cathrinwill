# AC Will Dev

<https://acwill.dev>

As this is my portfolio site, it means it's always a WIP, I break my own coding rules sometimes and every few years I find new fun tech and have to rebuild.

If you wanted to run it locally get started by first running `yarn install` then `yarn dev`, and if that didn't work pay attention to he `.nvmrc` file as this tells you the node version. However as you won't have my environment variables, and I'm not going to add them, so there won't be much to gain.

But most likely you're here to peep at my code, after seeing the website. So I've attached a screenshot of what you can't see from the Sanity CMS for a general idea:
